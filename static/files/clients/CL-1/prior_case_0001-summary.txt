CITATION: 1996 AIR 463 1995 SCC (6) [315 JT 1995] (7) 225 1995 SCALE (5)690
B.P. JEEVAN REDDY, J.
This appeal is preferred against the judgment of the Andhra Pradesh High Court answering the question referred to it in the negative, i.e., against the Revenue and in favour of the assessee. The question referred is "whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the capital gain of Rs.58,000 was assessable in the hands of the assessee in terms of Section 64(1) (iv) of the Income Tax Act, 1961." 1972) 83 I.T.R.208]. Counsel submits that though both these decisions were brought to the notice of the High Court, it has erred in distinguishing these two decisions and in following Prem Bhai Parekh. Even at the time of the said sale, Suryanarayana Reddy was a minor. It was only a case of substitution of one form of property by another form of property. The matter was ultimately carried to this Court. The connection between the transfer of assets and the income must be proximate. As pointed out by this Court, it is true that they were admitted to the benefits of partnership because of their contribution of the said capital but the income received by them was not directly relatable to or proportionate to the said investment. The income of the partnership arises from its business. Indeed, it is in this manner that this decision was understood and distinguished in the subsequent decision of this Court in Smt. When the learned counsel for the assessee relied upon the decision in Prem Bhai Parekh in support of his contention that there was no nexus between the income earned and the transfer of assets, it was repelled holding that in Prem Bhai Parekh, "the connection between the gifts made by the assessee and the income of the minors from the firm was a remote one and that it could not be said that the income arose directly or indirectly from the assets transferred".
